This is my personal website, created with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Scrolling animations were done with the [React Animate on Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animate-on-scroll) library.

The [wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/HGxRF6) was made with [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).

Deployment is done automatically on push to master using the [Deploy to GitHub Pages Workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages)
